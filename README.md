# Iterative-Mistake-Minimization
My python implementation of the "Iterative Mistake Minimization" algorithm, an explainable approximation of the k-means clustering algorithm proposed in https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.12538. Hoping to add some more functionality to this and get it on pip within the next year!
